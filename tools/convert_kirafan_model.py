        MsbHandler sorts by m_eRenderStage first, then m_RenderOrder, then
        m_HieIndex.  The stage used to be dropped here, and that is wrong for
        every player: a player ships TWO MsbHandler behaviours, one on
        Model_*_body(Clone) and one on Model_*_head(Clone), each numbering its
        own entries from zero.  Merging them on m_RenderOrder alone invents an
        ordering between the two groups that the game never had, because their
        ranges overlap -- pl_100001 is body 0..25 against head 1..26.

        What that cost: pl_100001's hat_L/hat_R are stage 7 with
        m_RenderOrder=20, and its L30_face is stage 22 with m_RenderOrder=6.
        The game draws stage 7 first, so the hat goes UNDER the face.  Flattened
        without the stage the hat became 20169 against the face's 6070 and
        painted over it, leaving 23 of the face's 12929 pixels -- a faceless
        Yuno.  Honouring the stage puts the face back at 3630 px, the eyes at
        1598 and the backhead at 2894, and moves no limb pixel at all
        (.codex-tmp/stage_ab.py, msb_lists.py, render_stage.py).

        Only three stages are in use.  Stage 7 is the depth-writing shells --
        arm, hand, chest, hat, cape, glove, weapons; stage 21 appears on 18
        enemies' body/leg/eye meshes; stage 22 is everything else, 1921 of the
        first 1965 meshes counted.  Enemies carry a single handler, so the stage
        only ever reorders them when one model mixes stages.

        The multipliers hold: over 400 bundles the maxima are m_HieIndex 137 and
        m_RenderOrder 106, both far inside the 1000 each key is given
        (.codex-tmp/order_range.py, stage_census.py).

        The stage is used exactly as authored, in both directions, because the
        question "which way does stage 7 go" has no global answer and the
        premise behind asking it was wrong.  Stage 7 holds the shells -- {chest,
        arm, hand} on pl_140000, plus hat_L/hat_R on pl_100001 -- and every
        reweighting tried so far traded one model for another: stage-7-first
        leaves pl_140000's inner shirt covered, stage-7-last cost 11 of 20
        sampled players their face to their own arm (.codex-tmp/
        regress_sample.py), and narrowing that to names 'chest'/'hat_*' only made
        the same mistake on fewer models.

        No rule keyed on this table can do better, because the table does not
        carry the distinction: on pl_140000 `chest` and `arm` agree in every draw
        key MsbHandler ships -- stage 7, m_RenderOrder 0, m_bVisibility 1 -- and
        differ only in m_HieIndex (170 vs 179).  A name test does not read
        authored data, it invents a "garment vs limb" split the data never makes.

        The shirt being covered is authored, not a defect.  `chest` carries
        _DepthWrite=0, so it writes no depth and the later-drawn coat paints over
        it in the game too; and raycasting the pixels a stage-7 -> 30 move
        changes shows `chest` is the front-most surface at only 59% of them,
        with cloth_A_1/cloth_A_2/tie_top/tie_under genuinely nearer at the rest
        (median gap .008-.015), so drawing the shirt later puts it over the
        necktie.  pl_140000's torso reads inside-out by design: blouse 0 -> band
        10,11 -> skirt 15,16 -> coat 17,18,19 -> tie 20,21.

        Still unexplained, and deliberately left alone rather than papered over:
        pl_100001's hat loses 17445 px under stage-first (.codex-tmp/
        stage_dir.py, stage_depth.py, msb_fields.py, depth_test.py).

        """Resize an alpha layer onto the colour map's grid.

        Enemies ship the alpha layer at half the colour map's resolution
        (model_en_7000: 256x256 against a 512x512 atlas), so this is a 2x
        upscale on most of them and a no-op on players.

        It has to be BILINEAR.  NEAREST turns every source texel into a hard
        2x2 block -- measured on model_en_7000, 100.0% of the 2x2 blocks in the
        edge band come out perfectly flat, against 0.6% for BILINEAR -- which
        replaces the authored 1-texel anti-aliased ramp with a staircase locked
        to the 256 grid.  The viewer then magnifies that ~3x (one atlas texel
        covers 2.75-3.40 device pixels), so each block becomes a ~6 pixel square
        step.  That staircase is baked into the texture, which is why no amount
        of MSAA or supersampling in the viewer could remove it.

        LANCZOS is not used: it keeps the gradient as steep as NEAREST (0.2228
        vs 0.2140, against BILINEAR's 0.1686) because it rings, and ringing on
        an alpha matte punches pinholes and haloes.

        The upscale is then gated on the source matte.  Interpolating outward
        from a source texel the artist left at alpha 0 lifts its neighbours above
        the 0.01 cutoff, and alphaMode MASK draws every surviving texel at full
        strength -- so those texels show whatever filler the colour atlas happens
        to hold outside the painted area.  Measured on model_en_7000's main
        atlas, the ungated upscale invents 13481 such texels (5.1% of the atlas):
        mean luminance 29.6 against 196.7 for the opaque body beside them, 12413
        of them darker than that body by more than 24 levels.  At this viewer's
        magnification (one atlas texel spans 2.75-3.40 device pixels) a
        one-texel band is a three-pixel black outline, which is what "黑边很重"
        reported.  Gating restores NEAREST's silhouette (157030 kept texels
        against 155968) while keeping BILINEAR's ramp: gradient over the painted
        edge band is 0.1873, against BILINEAR's 0.1810 and NEAREST's 0.2071.  Of
        the texels it drops, only 569 were within 24 levels of the body colour,
        so it is filler that goes, not authored detail (.codex-tmp/gate_sim.py).

        The darkness that remains inside the painted ramp is authored -- 71529
        texels here, and rgb/alpha does not recover the body colour from them
        (residual 96-143, .codex-tmp/premul.py), so the atlas is not simply
        premultiplied.  That band is repaired at load time instead; see
        core/texture-fringe.js.

        The gate only applies when the alpha layer is being magnified.  Some
        materials pair a tiny colour map with the full-size alpha atlas
        (model_en_7000's _flash is 4x4 RGB against 256x256 alpha), and there
        NEAREST is not a matte at all -- it point-samples 16 of 65536 texels, so
        gating on it zeroed 6 of the 16 for no reason.

        for every material of every msb object it branches on the *stage* and

        i.e. `_DepthWrite` itself.  So the asset's _DepthWrite is an authoring
        default the runtime discards; the stage is what decides.

        This is what the stage numbers mean, from Meige/eRenderStage.cs by
        ordinal: 7 is eRenderStage_Opaque and 22 is eRenderStage_Alpha.  The
        pair is a pass split, not a layer index -- opaque draws writing depth,
        then alpha draws depth-tested against it.  Which is why pl_140000's
        shirt belongs on screen: `chest` sits at stage 7 and writes depth, so

        Every character material in the fleet is drawn by one of two shaders --
        Meige/MeigeStandardShader and Meige/MeigeStandardShaderWithOutline, the
        `_outline` suffix on a material name meaning only "uses the variant with
        the extra rim pass", not "is translucent".  Both were dumped out of
        residentshaderpack.muast, and their ShaderLab pass state binds

            zWrite   <- [_DepthWrite]      zTest <- [_DepthTest]

        so the Standard-shader property names the materials also carry --
        _ZWrite, _SrcBlend, _DstBlend, _Mode -- reach no pass state at all.  They
        are leftovers from whatever material the artist started from, and reading
        them was reading dead metadata.  Worse, they are near-perfect complements
        of the live values, so every one of them was read *backwards*: over 606
        enemy bundles (1479 materials, all on those two shaders) _ZWrite
        disagreed with _DepthWrite 1455 times and agreed 24 (.codex-tmp/
        depth_census.py, shader_depth2.py).

        The blend half is still read here.  The depth half is NOT: it comes from
        depth_write_for_stage(), because MsbObjectHandler.Init() overwrites
        _DepthWrite from the mesh's render stage before anything draws, so the
        asset value is an authoring default the game discards.  Reading the
        asset value put 1403 materials at _DepthWrite=0 including `chest`, which
        is stage 7 (Opaque) and does write depth in the game -- that single
        mis-read is why pl_140000's blouse never appeared inside its open
        blazer, and no amount of reordering could fix it because the missing
        piece was the depth buffer, not the draw list.

        Keeping the stage as the source also preserves what the old reading got
        right by accident: `arm` and `hand` sit at stage 7 too, so they still
        write depth and still stop the later hair from painting over a nearer
        arm -- the case that motivated reading _DepthWrite in the first place
        (pl_140000's arm went 506 -> 4017 of its own 8310 px then, and the stage
        rule keeps it there).  Hair, face and most clothing are stage 22
        (Alpha), which the game gives depthWrite false, matching the value those
        materials happened to author and preserving coplanar fringe over face.

        The material name is not a usable proxy for any of this, and neither is
        the material identity: the `_body` material is shared by meshes on both
        sides of the split -- chest/arm/hand at stage 7 against most garments at
        stage 22 -- so callers must not set depth state on a shared material.
        add_generic_materials() splits it per depth group instead
        (.codex-tmp/material_stage_conflict.py, depth_census.py).

        The blend classification below still reads _Mode/_DstBlend.  It is left
        alone deliberately: both consumers of this glTF (models.js and
        core/loader.js) override `transparent` and the alpha cut with their own
        measured rules, so alphaMode changes no pixel, and rewriting it would
        churn every material entry for no visible gain.

    # Enemy bundles ship every mesh with m_IsActive true and carry no clips of
    # their own, so a straight export puts every alternate shell on screen at
    # once.  model_en_6000 draws five complete pose sets simultaneously -- five
    # arms out of one shoulder, three weapons across the torso -- and en_14405
    # stacks arm_L_1 on arm_L_2.
    #
    # The switch is in the anim bundle this method already opened for the
    # transform curves: MeigeAnimClip.m_AnimNodeHandlerArray, target type 9, the
    # same GameObject-visibility track build_visibility_table.py publishes for
    # players.  en_6000's idle clip carries a track for all 120 mesh nodes and
    # holds pose1_shoulder_ribon_L_obj at 0 from frame 0 to frame 64.
    #
    # This is worth insisting on because the alternative was guessing from names,
    # and a census over all 604 enemies showed names cannot decide it: the tokens
    # that mark a variant (`slash1`, `flip`, `copy`, `eye_angry`) are shaped
    # exactly like the tokens that mark a real part (`body_back`, `nose_ring`,
    # `tail_tip`, `chest_line`), and the numbered suffix is ambiguous in both
    # directions -- en_14405's arm_L_1/arm_L_2 are stacked alternates 0.001 of a
    # diagonal apart, while en_13703's kazehear_2..6 are five separate wind-hair
    # strands spread over 0.264.  Geometry cannot separate a 3-layer shoulder pad
    # from 3 alternate shoulder pads either.  The clip can, because it is what the
    # game itself plays.
    #
    # glTF has no node-visibility channel, so the tracks ride in the animation's
    # own extras: {node name: 0 | 1 | [[frame, value], ...]}.  A constant curve
    # collapses to one number, which is the common case.  Stepped keys
    # (m_CtrlType 2) hold the last value, so the viewer must not interpolate.
    # Players need no equivalent of this: their clips live in the shared
    # common_menu_body / common_battle_body bundles, and build_visibility_table.py
