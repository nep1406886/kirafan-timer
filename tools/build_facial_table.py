"""Build the authoritative expression tables the model viewer reads.

The game does not pick expressions by guessing which eye/mouth letter looks
right.  Every character ships anim/player/meigeac_{base}@facial.muast, a
MeigeAnimClip that CharacterAnim.SetFacial uses as a lookup table: the facial
ID is treated as a *frame number*, and for each eAnimTarget_MeshVisibility
node -- one per model layer, addressed by name -- the last keyframe whose
m_Frame <= facialID decides whether that layer is visible.

The action clips then author which facial ID they want.  A MabAnimEvent whose
m_iParam[0] == 1 calls SetFacial(m_iParam[1], m_iParam[2]), so "which face
goes with which motion" is authored data too, including the frame it changes
on.  m_iParam[2] is an override set ID resolved through CharacterFacialDB for
the two characters that need a different face than everyone else.

Facial IDs are grouped into one block per head direction.  Only one block is
ever visible at a time and the shipped GLBs carry geometry for L30 alone, so
an ID from another block is mapped to the L30 state at the same position in
its own block.

Outputs, both consumed by models.js:
  asset/models/facial/{base}.json   per-character states and ID lookup
  asset/models/facial/actions.json  action -> [[frame, facialID, overrideSet]]
and a "facial" key added to every player entry in asset/models/manifest.json.
