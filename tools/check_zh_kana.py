"""Flag kana that leaked into the Chinese half of a bilingual string.

Every line in this project is authored as {ja, zh}. The Japanese half is meant to
have kana; the Chinese half is not. When a term is coined in Japanese and pasted
straight into the Chinese line, a Chinese reader sees kana mid-sentence and reads
it as a rendering fault rather than as a name -- so it is worth catching
mechanically instead of by eye across every chapter.

Proper nouns that genuinely stay Japanese in both languages go in ALLOWED.
